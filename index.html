        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a passionate individual with a keen interest in technology and problem-solving. My journey has led me to AltSchool Africa, where I aim to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of engineering. I have always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and I'm excited to contribute to that shaping. As a Computer Science graduate from Bayero University Kano, I have basic foundation in web technologies and a passion for crafting engaging user experiences. My journey into frontend development began with hands-on learning during my NYSC, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the eHealth Africa Software Academy Bootcamp, alongside the Bootstrap framework. I further expanded my skillset through the challenging ALX Software Engineering program, gaining valuable insights into modern development practices.

            My professional experience as an IT Support Officer at FirstBank Nigeria, while not directly frontend-focused, sharpened my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail, crucial for debugging and optimizing frontend applications. My experience with the KaiOS pilot project for MTN, involving direct customer interaction and rapid iteration based on user feedback, provided invaluable experience in understanding user needs and translating them into practical frontend solutions.
            
            I possess a basic understanding of core frontend technologies and am eager to apply my skills to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces. I am a fast learner, committed to staying up-to-date with the latest frontend trends and best practices. I am confident in my ability to collaborate effectively with a team and contribute significantly to the success of this frontend project</p>

        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
            "Driven by a desire to specialize and elevate my existing web development skills, I joined the AltSchool Africa Frontend Engineering program. While my background includes a Computer Science degree and practical experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I recognized the need for a structured and intensive environment to deepen my expertise in frontend development. AltSchool's reputation for providing industry-relevant, project-based learning aligned perfectly with my goal of advancing my tech career and making a significant contribution to the field. Moreover, after navigating self-directed learning paths, I sought a more guided and comprehensive program to fill specific skill gaps and create a strong foundation for future frontend roles. The opportunity to learn alongside a community of aspiring developers and build valuable industry connections further solidified my decision to enroll in AltSchool's program."
